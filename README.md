# MY TEAM (Profile Generator)

A Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person in a software engineering team. Since testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, you will also write tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all unit tests.

A video below will demonstrate its functionality and all of the tests passing.
